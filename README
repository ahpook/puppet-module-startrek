startrek by Spencer Krum and William Van Hevelingen

This is the startrek module. It is to demonstrate the use of data-in-modules from Puppet 3.3.

This README is more blog post than README and describes our process to get d-i-m working.


First verify that you have Puppet 3.3

Then turn on module bindings by adding the following to puppet.conf

parser = future

Next create a test.pp file:

include startrek

Create a datadir in your module:

cd startrek
mkdir data
cd data
cat production.yaml
